# National GHG Emissions Project
Welcome to my data analysis project on national GHG emissions, with a focus on assessing green growth and emissions reductions progress. In this project, I completed the following general steps:

1. Developed a time series dataset using SQL (Big Query) to clean, transform, and merge multiple datasets.
2. Analyzed the dataset using R, which included additional data cleaning and transformation, as well as the development of several visualizations using ggplot2.
3. Developed forecasts of national GHG emissions to assess progress towards achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 using an ARIMA model to forecast emissions based on the 2000-2020 time series data.

Within this repository, I have hosted the following files:

- **National-GHG-Emissions-Dataset-SQL.md** - This file is the markdown file where I provide and discuss the SQL queries I carried out to develop the national GHG emissions dataset.
- **ghgs_time_series_9.csv** - This is the csv output of the dataset I developed through SQL queries. I also imported this dataset into R for further analyses.
- **national_ghg_emissions_exploratory.Rmd** - This is the raw version of the R Markdown file I developed that presents the analyses and forecasts I conducted, including the code I wrote and executed, descriptions of the code, interpretations of the analyses and forecasts, and additional background information.
- **national_ghg_emissions_exploratory.html** - This is the HTML output of the R Markdown file. It can be accessed at the following link on GitHub Pages: [https://sjkamens.github.io/National-GHG-Emissions-Project/national_ghg_emissions_exploratory.html](https://sjkamens.github.io/National-GHG-Emissions-Project/national_ghg_emissions_exploratory.html)
